# msd-sd-fatfs-logger


This code is a base program for a data logger with USB Mass Storage connection to transfer the logged file from SD Card to PC. The main difference of this repository with other ones is that it uses HAL and STM32CubeMX for stm32 microcontrollers.
 It is a demo which writes the clock on a text file on SD Card then enables USB Mass Storage to see the logged text file.
